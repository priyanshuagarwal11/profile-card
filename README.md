# My Profile Card Project

A responsive and visually appealing Profile Card built as part of my web development skill development journey. This project focuses on **HTML structure** and **CSS styling** to create a professional online presence.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is a simple yet elegant profile card that displays personal information, social media links, and engagement metrics (likes, comments, and shares). It demonstrates the ability to structure content correctly and style it using modern web standards.

### ✨ Features
* **Profile Image:** A circular headshot with a clean border.
* **Social Icons:** Quick links to Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.
* **Interaction Buttons:** "Subscribe" and "Message" buttons for user engagement.
* **Live Metrics:** Displays stats for 60k likes, 20k comments, and 12k shares.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Covered

* **HTML5 Structure:** Utilizing tags like `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
* **Content Hierarchy:** Proper use of headings for the name and paragraphs for the bio.
* **Embedding Media:** Correct implementation of profile and icon images.
* **CSS Layouts:** Managing spacing, alignment, and card-based design.
